**Example Prompts I Used:**
```
"Explain what Cobalt Strike is and how it's used in penetration testing"
"What is a Certificate Authority and what role does it play in TLS?"
"How do attackers use C2 servers?"
```

**Why This Helped:**
[Explain how AI helped you understand these concepts better for your analysis]

- [ ] Understanding tshark command-line options
- [ ] Debugging error messages
- [ ] Learning how to export objects from Wireshark
- [ ] Understanding how to decode base64 strings
- [ ] Other: ___________________________________

**Example Prompts I Used:**
```
"How do I filter for HTTP POST requests in Wireshark?"
"What's the tshark command to extract HTTP objects?"
"How do I decode base64 in the terminal?"
```

**Why This Helped:**
[Explain how AI helped you learn to use the tools more effectively]

- [ ] Debugging why filters weren't working
- [ ] Figuring out why I couldn't export certain files
- [ ] Understanding unexpected results in analysis
- [ ] Other: ___________________________________

**Example Issues I Got Help With:**
```
"I'm getting 'No matches found' when I filter for SMTP. What might be wrong?"
"Why can't I see domain names in HTTPS traffic?"
"How do I extract a password from base64-encoded SMTP traffic?"
```

**Why This Helped:**
[Explain how AI helped you overcome technical obstacles]

## What I DID NOT Use AI For

I confirm that I **did NOT** use AI for:

- [ ] ✅ Analyzing the PCAP file itself
- [ ] ✅ Answering the quiz questions directly
- [ ] ✅ Extracting data from packets
- [ ] ✅ Identifying IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- [ ] ✅ Drawing conclusions from the evidence
- [ ] ✅ Creating the timeline of events
- [ ] ✅ Determining which system was infected
- [ ] ✅ Finding domains, IPs, or file names in the PCAP

**All analysis, investigation, findings, and conclusions are entirely my own work** based on my personal examination of the provided PCAP file using Wireshark and related tools.

---

## Verification of Understanding

I certify that:

1. I **understand all content** in my submission
2. I can **explain any technique or finding** in my report
3. I personally **performed all the packet analysis**
4. I personally **answered all quiz questions** based on my own investigation
5. All **screenshots are from my own analysis sessions**
6. All **conclusions are my own** based on the evidence I found

If asked, I can:
- Demonstrate how I found any specific answer
- Explain any technical term or concept in my report
- Recreate any analysis step I documented
- Justify any conclusion I reached

---

## Academic Integrity Statement

I understand that:

- Using AI to directly answer assessment questions is academic misconduct
- Submitting AI-generated analysis as my own work is plagiarism
- I must be able to explain and defend all work I submit
- This declaration must accurately reflect my AI usage
- False declaration is a serious academic offense

I confirm that this declaration is **complete and accurate** to the best of my knowledge.
